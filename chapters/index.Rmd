# **Introduction** {-}

---

Researchers interested in studying the health impacts of climate change and related natural disasters need access to relevant, timely, and harmonized data on environmental exposures, social determinants of health variables, and health outcomes. However, such datasets are often developed for different purposes, reside in multiple locations, and require linkage.

The Climate and Health Outcomes Research Data Systems (CHORDS) Toolkit seeks to aid researchers in accessing, processing, and integrating geospatial data-based exposures into their health research by providing guides, tools, and example code. 

## About CHORDS {-}

The [Climate and Health Outcomes Research Data Systems (CHORDS)](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/chords) program provides resources aimed at making it easier for researchers to study the effects of place-based environmental exposures on health outcomes. The CHORDS resources include a [web-based data catalog](https://chords.niehs.nih.gov), standardized data sets, and this toolkit.

## About This Toolkit {-}

This toolkit provides guides, tools, and example code in `R`. The [CHORDS Toolkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/NIEHS/PCOR_bookdown_tools) provides the underlying code and data for this book. 

The CHORDS toolkit has been developed to support different types of users, such as students, clinicians, and data managers. Please see the [User Profile Appendix](#chapter-user-profiles) for descriptions and suggested relevant toolkit chapters for each user profile. 

This toolkit requires familiarity with the `R` programming language and the use of `R` for working with, visualizing, and analyzing scientific data. Please see the [Getting Started](#chapter-getting-started-spatial-resources) chapter for a list of resources for getting started with `R` for geospatial data analysis in environmental health research.

The toolkit consists of a series of chapters organized into the following units:

- **Geospatial Data Foundations**: This unit provides background, guidance and example code for working with different types of geospatial data common in environmental health research. This unit is intended as a starting point for users with less familiarity with geospatial data and geospatial analysis methods in environmental health using `R`.

- **Wildfire Data**: This unit provides guidance for working with different types of wildfire-related data in climate change and health research.

- **Other Environmental Data**: This unit provides guidance and code for working with specific sources of environmental data common in environmental health research for characterizing environmental exposures as well as social determinants of health.

- **Health Data Integration**: This unit provides guidance and code for integrating environmental and health data in climate change and health research, both at the individual level and at the population level.

- **Case Studies**: This unit provides example case studies that analyze integrated wildfire-related data and other environmental exposures data with health outcomes data.

The CHORDS Toolkit is a work in progress. Please see the [CHORDS Toolkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/NIEHS/PCOR_bookdown_tools) for a list of chapters currently in development.

_This is a BETA Release. Please let us know of any improvements we can make._
