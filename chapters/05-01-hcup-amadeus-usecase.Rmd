## Motivation

Understanding the relationship between external environmental factors and health outcomes is critical for guiding public health strategies and policy decisions. Integrating individual patient records from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) with data from environmental datasets allows researchers to examine how elements such as air quality, wildfire emissions, and extreme temperatures impact hospital visits and healthcare utilization patterns.

Ultimately, linking HCUP and environmental exposure data enhances public health monitoring and helps researchers better quantify environmental health risks.

### Outline

This tutorial includes the following steps:

1.  [Install R packages](#link-to-hcupAmadeus-0)

2.  [Data Curation and Prep](#link-to-hcupAmadeus-1)

3.  [Downloading and Processing Exposure Data with the `amadeus` Package](#link-to-hcupAmadeus-2)

## Tutorial

### Install R Packages {#link-to-hcupAmadeus-0}

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install required packages
install.packages(c("readr", "data.table", "sf", "tidyverse", "tigris", "dplyr",
                   "amadeus"))

# load required packages
library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(amadeus)
library(tigris)
library(dplyr)
```

## Data Curation and Prep {#link-to-hcupAmadeus-1}

HCUP data files from AHRQ can be obtained from their [HCUP Central Distributor](https://cdors.ahrq.gov/) site where it details the data use aggreement, how to purchase, protect, re-use and share the HCUP data.

Upon acquistion of HCUP database files, you will notice that the state files are distributed as large ASCII text files. These files contain the raw data and can be very large, as they store all of the individual records for hospital stays or procedures. ARHQ provides SAS software tools to assist with loading the data into [SAS](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/tech_assist/software/508course.jsp#structure) for analysis, however, this doesn't help when using other coding languages like R. To solve this we utilize the .loc files (also provided on HCUP website), the year of the data and the type of data file being loaded.

We will start with State level data: State Inpatient Database (SID), State Emergency Department Database (SEDD), and State Ambulatory Surgery and Services Database(SASD).

### Read and format HCUP datafiles

We start with defining the years of the data we have as well as the type of data we want to process. There is a core data file that all states have and additional files which may include Diagnosis and Procedure Groups, AHA Linkages, Charges, and/or Severity.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Define years and data type
years     <-  2021
data_type <- "CORE"

# Define possible data sources
data_sources <- "SEDD"
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Missing values definition
missing_values <- as.character(quote(c(-99, -88, -66, -99.9999999, -88.8888888,
                                       -66.6666666, -9, -8, -6, -5, -9999,
                                       -8888, -6666, -99999999, -999999999,
                                       -888888888, -666666666, -999, -888,
                                       -666)))

# Loop through data sources
for (data_source in data_sources) {
  # Create lowercase version with "c" appended
  data_source_lower_c <- paste0(tolower(data_source), "c")

  for (year in years) {
    # Determine fwf_positions based on the year
    # Year 2021 had a slightly different format on the specifications
    # at meta_url below
    if (year == 2021) {
      positions <- readr::fwf_positions(
        start = c(1, 5, 10, 28, 32, 64, 69, 73, 75, 80),
        end = c(3, 8, 26, 30, 62, 67, 72, 73, 78, NA)  # NA for ragged column
      )
    } else {
      positions <- readr::fwf_positions(
        start = c(1, 5, 10, 27, 31, 63, 68, 73, 75, 80),
        end = c(3, 8, 25, 29, 61, 66, 71, 73, 78, NA)  # NA for ragged column
      )
    }
```

The `fwf_positions()` function is utilizing column start and end positions found on the ahrq website (`meta_url` listed in next code chunk). We use these positions to read in the raw data files from their .asc format.

<figcaption>This is an example of the specifications loc file</figcaption>
:::

```{r eval = FALSE}
    # Read metadata with adjusted URL
    meta_url <- paste0("https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/",
                       data_source_lower_c, "/tools/filespecs/OR_",
                       data_source, "_", year, "_", data_type, ".loc")
    df <- readr::read_fwf(meta_url, positions, skip = 20)
    # Read data

    data_file <- paste0("../OR/", data_source, "/OR_", data_source, "_",
                        year, "_", data_type, ".asc")
    df2 <- readr::read_fwf(
      data_file,
      readr::fwf_positions(start = df$X6, end = df$X7, col_names = df$X5),
      skip = 2,
      na = missing_values
    )

    # Write output CSV
    output_file <- paste0("OR_", data_source, "_", year, "_", data_type, ".csv")
    write.csv(df2, file = output_file, row.names = FALSE)
  }
}
#Output file: OR_SEDD_2021_CORE.csv
```

We can test what that our positions are right for reading in raw data by printing `df`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(df)
# A tibble: 702 × 10

### Confirming data Characteristics

We now have or CSV formatted file `OR_SEDD_2021_CORE.csv`. We can check summary statistics for our data by going to HCUP databases page [here](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/databases.jsp).

To get to the summary table for our data we do the following:

1.  Click on the link for SEDD.

2.  Next we find the section on Data Elements

::: figure
<img src="images/hcup_amadeus_usecase/hcup_data_elements.png" style="width:100%"/>
:::

3.  From here we want to select `Summary Statistics for All States and Years`. This will redirect us to a page that allows the selection of our database attributes (state, year, database choice)

4.  Lastly we select the file we're interested in. In our example we downloaded the CORE file so that summary table will look like [this](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/db/state/seddc/tools/cdstats/OR_SEDDC_2021_SummaryStats_CORE.PDF).

## Downloading and Processing Exposure Data with the [`amadeus`](https://niehs.github.io/amadeus/) Package {#link-to-hcupAmadeus-2}

This section provides a step-by-step guide to downloading and processing wildfire smoke exposure data using the `amadeus` package. The process includes retrieving [Hazard Mapping System (HMS) smoke plume data](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/products/land/hms.html#0), spatially joining it with ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) for Oregon, and calculating summary statistics on smoke density.

### Step 1: Define Time Range

The first step is to specify the date range for which we want to download wildfire smoke exposure data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
time_range <- c("2021-01-01", "2021-12-31") # Range of dates for exposure data
```

### Step 2: Download HMS Smoke Plume Data

Using the `amadeus::download_hms()` function, we download HMS smoke plume data in shapefile format within the specified time range. The data will be saved in a local directory.

```{r eval=FALSE}
amadeus::download_hms(
  data_format = "shapefile",  # Specify format as shapefile
  date = time_range,          # Use the defined time range
  directory_to_save = "./data",  # Set the directory for saving files
  acknowledgement = TRUE,       # Accept the data use acknowledgement
  download = TRUE               # Enable downloading
)
```

### Step 3: Load Oregon ZIP Code Spatial Data

To analyze smoke exposure by geographic location, we retrieve ZCTA boundaries for Oregon using the `tigris` package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
or <- tigris::zctas(state = "OR", year = 2010)  # Get Oregon ZCTA boundaries
```

### Step 4: Process HMS Data

Once the raw HMS data is downloaded, we process it using `process_hms()`. This function cleans and filters the data based on the given time range and geographic extent (Oregon ZCTAs).

```{r eval=FALSE}
cov_h <- process_hms(
  date = time_range,          # Specify the date range
  path = "./data/data_files/", # Path to the downloaded data files
  extent = sf::st_bbox(or)    # Limit processing to Oregon's spatial extent
)
```

### Step 5: Extract Smoke Plume Values at ZIP Code Locations

Using `calculate_hms()`, we extract wildfire smoke plume values at the ZIP code (ZCTA) level. This function returns a data frame containing `locs_id`, `date`, and a binary variable for wildfire smoke plume density.

```{r eval=FALSE}
temp_covar <- calculate_hms(
  covariate = "hms",                     # Specify the covariate type
  from = cov_h,                           # Use the processed HMS data
  locs = tigris::zctas(state = "OR", year = 2010), # Use Oregon ZIP code bounds
  locs_id = "ZCTA5CE10",                  # Define ZIP code identifier
  radius = 0,                              # No buffer radius
  geom = "sf"                              # Return as an sf object
)

# Save processed data
saveRDS(temp_covar, "smoke_plume_covar.R")
```

In preparation for the next section we are going to make two new dataframes from our `temp_covar` object. The first collapses our zipcodes taking the average of light, medium, or heavy days.

```{r eval=FALSE}
avg_smoke_density <- temp_covar %>%
  group_by(ZCTA5CE10) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_light = mean(light_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_medium = mean(medium_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_heavy = mean(heavy_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
  )
print(avg_smoke_density)
saveRDS(avg_smoke_density, "smoke_density_avg_byZip.R")

# > head(avg_smoke_density)
# # A tibble: 6 × 4
#   ZCTA5CE10 avg_light avg_medium avg_heavy
#   <fct>         <dbl>      <dbl>     <dbl>
# 1 97833         0.129     0.194     0.419 
# 2 97840         0.161     0.226     0.387 
# 3 97330         0.290     0.129     0.0323
# 4 97004         0.258     0.0968    0.0323
# 5 97023         0.194     0.0968    0.0323
# 6 97042         0.258     0.129     0.0323
```

The second dataframe also groups by our zip but takes the summation of the smoke plume days instead of an average.

```{r eval=FALSE}
total_smoke_density <- temp_covar %>%
  group_by(ZCTA5CE10) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_light = sum(light_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum_medium = sum(medium_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
    sum_heavy = sum(heavy_00000, na.rm = TRUE),
    geometry = st_union(geometry)
  )
print(total_smoke_density)
saveRDS(total_smoke_density, "smoke_density_total_byZip.R")

# > head(total_smoke_density)
# # A tibble: 6 × 5
#   ZCTA5CE10 sum_light sum_medium sum_heavy                            geometry
#   <fct>         <int>      <int>     <int>                      <GEOMETRY [°]>
# 1 97833             4          6        13 MULTIPOLYGON (((-118.1571 44.9990,…

```

## Data Analysis using HCUP and Amadeus data sources

First we will load in our hcup data file we processed earlier and subset the file to a set of observations that make the data easier to work with (702 to 39 columns) and are still interesting for analysis. This includes zipcodes, age at admission, admission month, race identifier, sex, and ICD 10 diagnosis codes.

```{r eval=FALSE}
or_sedd_2021 <- fread("OR_SEDD_2021_CORE.csv")
subset_data <- or_sedd_2021 %>%
  select(FEMALE, ZIP, PSTCO, AGE, RACE, AMONTH, starts_with("I10_"))
head(subset_data)

# [1] "FEMALE"               "ZIP"                  "PSTCO"               
#  [4] "AGE"                  "RACE"                 "AMONTH"              
#  [7] "I10_DX_Visit_Reason1" "I10_DX_Visit_Reason2" "I10_DX_Visit_Reason3"
# [10] "I10_DX1"              "I10_DX2"              "I10_DX3"             
# [13] "I10_DX4"              "I10_DX5"              "I10_DX6"             
# [16] "I10_DX7"              "I10_DX8"              "I10_DX9"             
# [19] "I10_DX10"             "I10_DX11"             "I10_DX12"            
# [22] "I10_DX13"             "I10_DX14"             "I10_DX15"            
# [25] "I10_DX16"             "I10_DX17"             "I10_DX18"            
# [28] "I10_DX19"             "I10_DX20"             "I10_DX21"            
# [31] "I10_DX22"             "I10_DX23"             "I10_DX24"            
# [34] "I10_DX25"             "I10_DX26"             "I10_DX27"            
# [37] "I10_DX28"             "I10_NDX"              "I10_PROCTYPE"        

```

Next we will select July as our month of interest to further reduce the size of the data and to focus on a time frame where we know fires took place in Oregon. We will also load in our environmental data files we made above from amadeus.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# subset data to July
july_subset_hcup_data <- subset_data[subset_data$AMONTH == 7,]

# load in amadeus files we made previously
avg_smoke_density <- readRDS("smoke_density_avg_byZip.R")
total_smoke_density <- readRDS("smoke_density_total_byZip.R")
```

### Merging Environmental Data with Hospital Data

We will now merge our environmental data into our hospital discharge (HCUP) data using an inner join on ZIP codes present in both datasets.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Perform an inner join to merge `july_subset_hcup_data` with 
# `avg_smoke_density` based on the ZIP code (`ZIP` in HCUP data and 
# `ZCTA5CE10` in smoke density data)
merged_data <- inner_join(july_subset_hcup_data, avg_smoke_density,
                          by = c("ZIP" = "ZCTA5CE10"))

# Perform another inner join to add `total_smoke_density` to the existing 
# `merged_data`
merged_data <- inner_join(merged_data, total_smoke_density,
                          by = c("ZIP" = "ZCTA5CE10"))
```

### Identifying Asthma Cases

Next, we will identify individuals diagnosed with asthma. This involves searching for the ICD-10 code "J45" within the diagnosis columns of our dataset.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Identify the columns containing diagnosis codes (prefix "I10_")
diag_columns <- grep("^I10_", colnames(merged_data), value = TRUE)

# Create a new column `has_asthma` that checks if any diagnosis contains "J45"
smoke_summary <- merged_data %>%
  mutate(has_asthma = apply(select(., all_of(diag_columns)), 1, function(x) {
    any(grepl("J45", x))
  }))

# Count total number of individuals in the dataset
total_individuals <- nrow(smoke_summary)

# Count the number of individuals with an asthma diagnosis
asthma_cases <- sum(smoke_summary$has_asthma, na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate the proportion of individuals diagnosed with asthma
asthma_rate <- asthma_cases / total_individuals
```

### Visualizing the Relationship Between Heavy Smoke Exposure and Asthma

We will now generate a boxplot to visualize the distribution of average heavy smoke days across individuals with and without an asthma diagnosis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(smoke_summary, aes(x = factor(has_asthma), y = avg_heavy,
                          fill = factor(has_asthma))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    x = "Has Asthma (J45)",
    y = "Average Heavy Smoke Days",
    fill = "Has Asthma",
    title = "Average Heavy Smoke Days vs Asthma Diagnosis"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Logistic Regression Analysis

Finally, we fit a logistic regression model to examine the relationship between asthma diagnoses and exposure to different levels of smoke density.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Fit a logistic regression model with asthma diagnosis as the outcome variable
# and different smoke exposure levels as predictors
model <- glm(has_asthma ~ avg_light + avg_medium + avg_heavy, 
             data = smoke_summary, family = binomial)

# Display model summary
summary(model)
# Call:
# glm(formula = has_asthma ~ avg_light + avg_medium + avg_heavy, 
#     family = binomial, data = smoke_summary)
# 
# Coefficients:
#             Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|)    
# (Intercept) -3.38823    0.09077 -37.329  < 2e-16 ***
# avg_light   -0.21258    0.30322  -0.701    0.483    
# avg_medium   1.74996    0.32456   5.392 6.98e-08 ***
# avg_heavy    1.82572    0.16826  10.850  < 2e-16 ***
# ---
# Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
# 
# (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
# 
#     Null deviance: 42004  on 111124  degrees of freedom
# Residual deviance: 41674  on 111121  degrees of freedom
# AIC: 41682
# 
# Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 6
```

The output provides estimates for each predictor, helping us assess the impact of light, medium, and heavy smoke exposure on asthma prevalence.
