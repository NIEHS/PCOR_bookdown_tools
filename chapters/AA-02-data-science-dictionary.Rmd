#### Electronic Health Record (EHR) {#def-ehr .unnumbered .unlisted}

The digital files describing a patient's medical history that are maintained by a health provider. EHRs include information such as demographics, progress notes, diagnoses, medications, and test results.
                                                                               
**Context:** EHRs are common data sources in various environmental health applications.

#### Geocoded Address {#def-geocoded-address .unnumbered .unlisted}

The geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude) associated with a street address (e.g., home or work location).  
                                                                               
**Context:** Geocoded addresses are commonly used as a basis for geospatial exposure assessment for individuals.

#### Geocoding {#def-geocoding .unnumbered .unlisted}

The process of converting place names or street addresses to geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude).
                                                                               
**Context:** Geocoding is a common data processing step in geospatial exposure assessment.

#### Geographic Unit (Areal Unit) {#def-geographic-unit .unnumbered .unlisted}

A specific place defined by administrative or political geographic boundaries (e.g., state, census tract, country, postal code), environmental boundaries (e.g., watershed) or a grid (e.g., grid cell in a 1 km grid).
                                                                               
**Context:** Data for social and environmental determinants of health are often provided for different types of geographic units (e.g., census tracts, grid cells).

#### Geoid {#def-geoid .unnumbered .unlisted}

A unique identifying code for a place or geographic unit (e.g., census tract, city, postal code, land parcel, watershed).
                                                                               
**Context:** Geoid is commonly used as a basis for data integration at the individual and population level.

#### Geospatial Data {#def-geospatial-data .unnumbered .unlisted}

Data that includes information about specific times and places on the Earth.  
                                                                               
**Context:** Geospatial data can be used to assess individual and population level exposures to environmental and social determinants of health.
