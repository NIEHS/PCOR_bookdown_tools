## Data

Wildfire smoke plume coverage data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will be used to demonstrate using polygon data. This section will cover polygon data with both the `sf` (@r-sf-1) and `terra` (@r-terra) packages separately, but the steps for accessing, downloading, and unzipping the data is the same for both packages.

## Access, download, and unzip

The website URL where the NOAA wildfire smoke plume data exists is date-specific, meaning there is a unique URL for each daily data set. For the purpose of these exploratory analyses, wildfire smoke plume data from September 1, 2023 will be used.

Define three variables for `day`, `month`, and `year` according to the date of interest.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day <- "01"
month <- "09"
year <- "2023"
```

The `utils::download.file()` function downloads the file according to the defined URL and destination file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url_noaa <- paste0(
  "https://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/FIRE/web/HMS/Smoke_Polygons",
  "/Shapefile/",
  year,
  "/",
  month,
  "/hms_smoke",
  year,
  month,
  day,
  ".zip"
)

destination_noaa <- paste0(
  "/   YOUR FILE PATH   /noaa_smoke",
  year,
  month,
  day,
  ".zip"
)

download.file(
  url_noaa,
  destination_noaa
)
```

The file downloaded from the NOAA website is a `.zip` file. Zip files need to be unzipped (decompressed) in order to access the data within. Unzip the NOAA wildfire smoke plume coverage file with `utils::unzip()`.

::: {.warning}
Unzipping a `.zip` file will decompress the contents within. Spatial data sets can be very large (ie. \> 1GB), so check the size of the data before unzipping on your machine.
:::

The numeric value size of each file is listed under `Length`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unzip("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /noaa_smoke20230901.zip",
  list = TRUE
)
```

After inspecting the file sizes, unzip `noaa_smoke20230901.zip`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unzip("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /noaa_smoke20230901.zip")
```

Inspecting the file with `utils::unzip(list = TRUE)` returned the size of the file, but also the name of the data file of interest. The desired data file can also be identified with `list.files()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /")
```

Listing the contents of the unzipped file reveals four individual files. The data to be imported is stored in the `hms_smoke20230901.shp`, but the other files contain important information for the `.shp` file.

::: {.warning}
Deleting any of the supporting files (ie. `*.dbf`, `*.prj`, or `*.shx`) will disrupt the data import.
:::

## Polygon Data with `sf`

This section will focus on exploratory analyses with polygon data using the `sf` package.

### Import {-}

Now that the contents of the zip file have been saved on your machine and the data file of interest has been identified, import the data with `sf::st_read()`.

::: {.note}
Although the supporting files are required to import a shapefile, only the file ending in `.shp` needs to be imported
:::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf <- st_read("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /hms_smoke20230901.shp")
```

Importing `hms_smoke20230901.shp` does not return a `Warning:` message because the data set has native spatial features, and is therefore imported as an `sf` object.

### Inspect structure {-}

Inspect the structure of `smoke_sf` to see its class, column names, column classes, and the first two (specified by `vec.len = 2`) data points.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str(smoke_sf,
  vec.len = 2
)
```

As mentioned previously, the `smoke_sf` data set has native spatial features. These are reflected by the data set having classes of `sf` and `data.frame`, and the `$geometry` feature.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(smoke_sf)
```

### Reclassify {-}

The main parameter of interest in this data set is `$Density`, which discretely categorizes each wildfire smoke plume as "Light", "Medium", or "Heavy". Checking its class shows that `$Density` is class character.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(smoke_sf$Density)
```

Nominal data, data without fixed order or rank system, can be stored as class character (ie. State names). However, it is best to store ordinal data as class factor for conducting analyses in R.

Converting data from class character to class factor can be done with `factor()`. The `levels = c()` argument in the function specifies both the level names and the ranked order of the levels.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf$Density <- factor(smoke_sf$Density,
  levels = c("Light", "Medium", "Heavy")
)
```

Check the class of `$Density` again to ensure proper reclassification.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(smoke_sf$Density)
```

### Coordinate reference system and projection {-}

Check the coordinate reference system of an `sf` object with `sf::st_crs()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
st_crs(smoke_sf)
```

`smoke_sf` has a native coordinate reference system which was imported during the `sf::st_read()` step. The area of interest for these exploratory analyses is the coterminous United States, so we can transform `smoke_sf` to the Albers Equal Area projected coordinate system (EPSG code: 5070).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf <- st_transform(
  smoke_sf,
  5070
)
```

### Plot (single) {-}

With the data prepared, plot the wildfire smoke plume polygons with `ggplot2::ggplot()`.

Now that the parameters of interest and coordinate reference system have been prepared, create a plot with `ggplot2::ggplot()`. Identifying the data set to be plotted within the `geom_sf()` arguement informs the function that the data is an `sf` object.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = smoke_sf,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_sf_original.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

The wildfire smoke plume polygons are clearly visible and colored according to their individual smoke density classification. This plot, however, is difficult to interpret for two reasons. First, there are multiple polygons for each smoke density classification. Multiple borders and overlapping polygons with the same smoke density type can be confusing. To make the polygons more clear, individual polygons for each smoke density classification can be combined.

::: {.warning}
For the purposes of these exploratory analyses, the satellite travelling direction and time of collection will be ignored.
:::

### Union {-}

Individual polygons can be unioned (combined) into one multi-part polygon with `sf::st_union`. The `group_by(Density)` argument specifies that the polygons should be combined based on the value stored in `$Density`. Adding the `Date = paste0(...` argument within the `dplyr::summarise()` function creates a parameter to store the date based on the year, month, and day of the data (defined in 2.0 Access, download, and unzip).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf_density <-
  smoke_sf %>%
  group_by(Density) %>%
  summarise(
    geometry = st_union(geometry),
    Date = paste0(
      year,
      month,
      day
    )
  )
```

The resulting data set contains three multi-polygons, a column for the smoke plume classification, and a column for the date.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf_density
```

Creating a new plot with `smoke_sf_density`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = smoke_sf_density,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (unioned)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_sf_unioned.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

The plot is still difficult to interpret because it lacks geospatial context. The grid lines provide latitude and longitude references, but physical or geopolitical boundaries can help show where the wildfire smoke plumes are relative to the study area of interest. To provide geospatial context to the wildfire smoke plume polygons, we can add the United States' state boundary polygons to the plot.

### Plot (multiple) {-}

The steps taken to access, download, unzip, and import the United States' state boundary data are the same as those taken for the wildfire smoke plume coverage data. Refer to sections 2.0 Access, download, and unzip, and 2.1.1 Import for detailed descriptions.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
url_states <-
  "https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2018/shp/cb_2018_us_state_500k.zip"

destination_states <- "/   YOUR FILE PATH   /states.zip"

download.file(
  url_states,
  destination_states
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unzip("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /states.zip",
  list = TRUE
)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
unzip("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /states.zip")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
list.files("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
states <- st_read("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /cb_2018_us_state.shp")
```

Inspect the structure of `states_sf`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str(states_sf,
  vec.len = 2
)
```

For the purpose of these exploratory analyses, only the coterminous (CONUS) United States will be used. Subset `states_sf` to remove Alaska, Hawaii, and the United States' territories.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remove <- c(
  "Alaska",
  "Hawaii",
  "Puerto Rico",
  "United States Virgin Islands",
  "Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands",
  "Guam",
  "American Samoa"
)

conus_sf <- subset(
  states_sf,
  !NAME %in% remove
)
```

Check the coordinate reference system.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
st_crs(conus_sf)
```

::: {.important}
When analyzing multiple spatial data sets together, all data sets must have the same coordinate reference system or projected coordinate system.
:::

Transform `conus_sf` to match the projected coordinate system of the `smoke_sf_density` data set.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
conus_sf <- st_transform(
  conus_sf,
  st_crs(smoke_sf_density)
)
```

Plot the coterminous United States's state boundaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = conus_sf) +
  ggtitle("Coterminous United States' State Boundaries") +
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/conus_sf_original.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

With the wildfire smoke plume and coterminous United States polygons imported and prepared, ensure that they have the same coordinate reference system.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
st_crs(smoke_sf_density) == st_crs(conus_sf)
```

Create a plot which shows the distribution of wildfire smoke plumes over the coterminous United States' state boundaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = smoke_sf_density,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = conus_sf,
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (with states)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_sf_states.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

This plot provides important geospatial context for understanding where the wildfire smoke plumes are in relation to the study area of interest.

### Crop {-}

The `sf::st_crop()` function can be used to reduce the extent of a set of polygons to a specific rectangle, typically the bounding box of another spatial data set. In this example we can crop the `smoke_sf_density` polygons to the bounding box surrounding the coterminous United States.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_sf_crop <- st_crop(
  smoke_sf_density,
  conus_sf
)
```

Plot the cropped wildfire smoke plume polygons and the coterminous United States' state boundaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(
    data = smoke_sf_crop,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  geom_sf(
    data = conus_sf,
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (cropped)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_sf_cropped.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

## Polygon Data with `terra`

This section will focus on exploratory analyses with polygon data using the `terra` package (@r-terra).

### Import {-}

Now that the contents of the zip files have been saved on your machine and the data files of interest have been identified, import both the wildfire smoke plume coverage data and the United States' state boundary data with `terra::vect()`.

::: {.note}
See sections 2.0 Access, download, and unzip and 2.1.7 Plot (multiple) for obtaining the wildfire smoke plume coverage and United States' state boundary data sets, respectively.
:::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t <- vect("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /hms_smoke20230901.shp")
states_t <- vect("/   YOUR FILE PATH   /cb_2018_us_state_500k.shp")
```

### Inspect structure {-}

Inspect the structures of `smoke_t` and `states_t` to see their classes, column names, column classes.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t
states_t
```

Both `smoke_t` and `states_t` have native spatial features. These are reflected by the type of spatial data in `geometry:`, and the spatial attributes `extent:` and `coord. ref.:`

### Reclassify {-}

The main parameter of interest in this data set is `$Density`, which discretely categorizes each wildfire smoke plume as "Light", "Medium", or "Heavy". Checking its class shows that `$Density` is class character.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(smoke_t$Density)
```

Nominal data, data without fixed order or rank system, can be stored as class character (ie. State names). However, it is best to store ordinal data as class factor for conducting analyses in R.

Converting data from class character to class factor can be done with `factor()`. The `levels = c()` argument in the function specifies both the level names and the ranked order of the levels.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t$Density <- factor(smoke_t$Density,
  levels = c("Light", "Medium", "Heavy")
)
```

Check the class of `$Density` again to ensure proper reclassification.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
class(smoke_t$Density)
```

For the purpose of these exploratory analyses, only the coterminous (CONUS) United States will be used. Subset `states_t` to remove Alaska, Hawaii, and the United States' territories.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remove <- c(
  "Alaska",
  "Hawaii",
  "Puerto Rico",
  "United States Virgin Islands",
  "Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands",
  "Guam",
  "American Samoa"
)

conus_t <- subset(
  states_t,
  !states_t$NAME %in% remove
)
```

### Coordinate reference system and projection {-}

Check the coordinate reference systems of `SpatVector` objects with `terra::crs()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
crs(smoke_t,
  describe = TRUE
)
crs(conus_t,
  describe = TRUE
)
```

Both data sets have native coordinate reference systems which were imported during the `terra::vect()` step. The two data sets, however, have different coordinate reference systems from each other. The area of interest for these exploratory analyses is the coterminous United States, so we can project `smoke_t` and `conus_t` to the Albers Equal Area projected coordinate system (EPSG code: 5070).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t <- project(
  smoke_t,
  "EPSG:5070"
)
conus_t <- project(
  conus_t,
  "EPSG:5070"
)
```

Although both data sets were transformed to the same projected coordinate system, it is important to ensure that all data sets have the same coordinate reference system or projected coordinate system.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
crs(smoke_t) == crs(conus_t)
```

### Plot (multiple) {-}

Plot both data sets together in one plot with `ggplot2::ggplot()`.

Now that the parameters of interest and coordinate reference systems have been prepared, create a plot with `ggplot2::ggplot()`. Identifying the data sets to be plotted within the `tidyterra::geom_spatvector()` arguments informs the function that the data are `SpatVector` objects (@r-tidyterra).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = smoke_t,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = conus_t,
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (with states)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_terra_original.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

The wildfire smoke plume polygons are clearly visible and colored according to their individual smoke density classification. The plot, however, is difficult to interpret because there are multiple polygons for each smoke density classification. Multiple borders and overlapping polygons with the same smoke density type can be confusing. To make the polygons more clear, individual polygons for each smoke density classification can be combined.

::: {.warning}
For the purposes of these exploratory analyses, the satellite travelling direction and time of collection will be ignored.
:::

### Aggregate {-}

Individual polygons an be aggregated (combined) into one multi-part polygon with `terra::aggregate()`. The `by = "Density"` argument specifies that the polygons should be combined based on the value stored in `$Density`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t_density <- terra::aggregate(smoke_t,
  by = "Density",
  dissolve = TRUE
)
```

Aggregating the polygons based on the values stored in the `$Density` column can result in the other columns containing `NA` values. To remove these columns, subset `smoke_t_density` to remove `$Satellite`, `$Start`, and `$End`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t_density <- smoke_t_density[
  seq_len(nrow(smoke_t_density)),
  c("Density", "agg_n")
]
```

The resulting data set contains three multi-polygons, a column for the smoke plume classification, and a count of the number of individual polygons that were aggregated to create the multi-polygon. This last column, `$agg_n` is automatically calculated by the `terra::aggregate()` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t_density
```

Create a new plot with `smoke_t_density`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = smoke_t_density,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = conus_t,
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (aggregated)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  grids()
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_terra_aggregated.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

### Crop {-}

The `terra::crop()` function can be used to reduce `SpatVector` to an area determined by another `SpatVector`. In this example, we can crop the `smoke_t_density` polygons to the coterminous United States' state boundaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
smoke_t_crop <- terra::crop(
  smoke_t_density,
  conus_t
)
```

Plot the cropped wildfire smoke plume polygons and the coterminous United States' state boundaries.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = smoke_t_crop,
    aes(fill = Density)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual("Smoke Density",
    values = c("lightgreen", "lightgoldenrod", "tomato")
  ) +
  geom_spatvector(
    data = conus_t,
    fill = "transparent"
  ) +
  ggtitle("Wildfire Smoke Plumes (cropped)") +
  theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.line = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank()
  )
```

<img src="images/intro_to_spatial/smoke_polygons_terra_cropped.png" width = "75%" height = "auto" class = "centerimage">

### Zonal statistics {-}

Looking closely at the previous plot, it is clear that wildfire smoke plumes cover each state differently. The `terra` package can be used to identify which states are covered by each classification of wildfire smoke plumes.

The `terra::relate()` function can be used to identify spatial relationships between two `SpatVector` objects. The `relation = "intersects"` argument logically identifies if any portion of each state is or is not covered by each of the three wildfire smoke plume classification multi-polygons.

The output of `terra::relate()` is a wide matrix. The nested `data.frame()` and `t()` wrappers convert the output from a wide matrix to a long data frame, which is required to combine the results with the `conus_t` data set.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
conus_smoke <- data.frame(
  t(
    relate(smoke_t_density,
      conus_t,
      relation = "intersects"
    )
  )
)
```

Set the column names of `conus_smoke` to match the smoke density classifications.

::: {.note}
The order of the columns in `conus_smoke` are based on the ordered factor levels in `smoke_t_density$Density` (see 2.2.3 Reclassify).
:::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colnames(conus_smoke) <- c("Light", "Medium", "Heavy")
```

Combine the wildfire smoke plume indicator data frame with the the coterminous United States' state boundaries data.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
conus_t <- cbind(
  conus_t,
  conus_smoke
)
```

The `conus_t` data set now contains separate columns indicating the presence or absence of "Light", "Medium", and "Heavy" wildfire smoke plumes for each coterminous state.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(conus_t)
```

### Plot (`for` Loop) {-}

A `for` loop can be used to create indicator plots for each wildfire smoke plume classification. The layout of a `for` loop can look complicated, but it simply applies the same set of functions to a given list of inputs.

The list of inputs must first be created. As the goal is to plot each of the wildfire smoke plume density classifications, create a character vector of the three classification names.

This "list of inputs" must first be created. Store the three wildfire smoke plume classifications in a vector of class character.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dens_c <- c("Light", "Medium", "Heavy")
```

Create a `for` loop that creates a plot for each wildfire smoke plume density stored within `dens_c`.

Code line 1 tells the `for` loop to apply the following functions to each observation in `dens_c`.

Code lines 3 through 9 define the plotting colors based on the wildfire smoke plume classification (`dens_c[d]`). As in previous plots, "Light" smoke plumes will be colored green, "Medium" smoke plumes will be covered yellow, and "Heavy" smoke plumes will be colored red.

Code lines 12 through 32 create the plot based on the wildfire smoke plume classification (`dens_c[d]`), and previously defined plotting colors (`color_values`).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for (d in seq_along(dens_c)) {
  # define color palette based on smoke density
  if (dens_c[d] == "Light") {
    color_values <- c("lightgrey", "lightgreen")
  } else if (dens_c[d] == "Medium") {
    color_values <- c("lightgrey", "lightgoldenrod")
  } else if (dens_c[d] == "Heavy") {
    color_values <- c("lightgrey", "tomato")
  }

  # create plot
  print(
    ggplot() +
      geom_spatvector(
        data = conus_t,
        aes_string(fill = dens_c[d])
      ) +
      scale_fill_manual(
        paste0(
          dens_c[d],
          " Smoke Plume Coverage Present"
        ),
        values = color_values
      ) +
      theme_pubr(legend = "bottom") +
      theme(
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.line = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank()
      )
  )
}
```
