## Introduction

### Motivation

Environmental health research relies on various types of data to accurately measure, model, and predict exposures. Environmental data are often spatial (related to the surface of the Earth), temporal (related to a specific time or period of time), or spatio-temporal (related to the surface of the Earth for a specific time or period of time). Here, the term _geospatial_ will be used to refer to spatial and spatio-temporal data. These data are at the core of environmental health research, but the steps between identifying a geospatial data set or variable and using it to help answer a research question can be challenging.

### Objectives

The objectives of this chapter are to:

1. Introduce concepts and terminology used in the following tutorials for geospatial data and geospatial analysis methods.
2. Describe the geospatial datasets and `R` packages used in the following tutorials.
3. Provide a list of useful resources for getting started with `R` and for further exploration of geospatial data analysis methods in environmental health.

The following chapters in this unit will demonstrate how to use `R` to access, prepare, and analyze different types of geospatial data that are commonly used in environmental health applications. The tutorials will focus primarily on spatial data, but some aspects of temporal and spatio-temporal data will also be discussed.

## Concepts and Terminology

### Spatial Geometry

The _spatial geometry_ of a geospatial dataset is an important consideration in data analysis pipelines. There are three main spatial geometry types: point, line, and area (i.e., polygon or grid). _Points_ are represented by geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude pairs), _lines_ by a series of connected points, and _polygons_ by a series of connected points that completely enclose and define an area. In contrast to polygons, which can define irregular or non-uniform areas, _grids_ define regular and uniform areas (e.g., such that each grid cell has the same area). Point, line, and polygon data is referred to as _vector_ data, and grid data is referred to as _raster_ data. For detailed descriptions of vector data, raster data, and the differences between them, respectively, see [@r-sf-1], [@raster-data] and [@geocomputation-2].

The following table illustrates common examples of each spatial geometry type used in environmental health applications.

<figcaption>Spatial Geometry Types</figcaption>

|Type  |Illustration |Examples                                      |Tutorials  |
|------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|
|Point (Vector) |![](images/intro_to_spatial/illustration-point.png){width=60%} |Air pollution monitors, Weather stations, Patient geocoded addresses, Healthcare facility coordinates |[Point Data](#chapter-point-data) |
|Line (Vector) |![](images/intro_to_spatial/illustration-line.png){width=60%} |Roads, Commute routes | |
|Polygon (Vector)|![](images/intro_to_spatial/illustration-polygon.png){width=60%} |Wildfire smoke plumes, Census boundaries |[Polygon Data](#chapter-polygon-data) |
|Grid (Raster) |![](images/intro_to_spatial/illustration-grid.png){width=60%} |Land cover imagery from satellites, Meteorological model output, Gridded population counts |[Raster Data](#chapter-raster-data) |

The tutorials linked in the table above demonstrate exploratory analyses with each spatial geometry data type.

### Coordinate Reference Systems and Projections {#getting-started-spatial-crs}

Coordinate reference systems (CRS) are important for spatial analyses as they define how spatial data align with the Earth's surface [@geocomputation-24]. Transforming (projecting) the data to a different CRS may be necessary when combining multiple datasets or creating visuals for particular areas of interest. It is important to note that transforming spatial data can cause distortions in its area, direction, distance, or shape [@geocomputation-24]. The direction and magnitude of these distortions vary depending on the chosen CRS, area of interest, and type of data [@article_steinwand1995reprojection]. For guidance on selecting an appropriate CRS based on the data, area of interest, and analysis goals, see [@arcgis-crs; @usgs-projections].

## Datasets

The tutorials in this unit demonstrate the use of geospatial data using the following publicly available datasets: 

| Data Provider   | Dataset         | Type  |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) | [PM~2.5~ Daily Observations](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html) | Point |
| National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | [Wildfire Smoke Plumes](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html) | Polygon |
| United States Census Bureau | [United States Cartographic Boundary](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html) | Polygon |
| National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) | [Land Surface Temperature](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.narr.html) | Raster |

## `R` Packages

The tutorials in this unit demonstrate the use of the following `R` packages:

-   **Spatial Analysis:** [`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/sf.pdf) [@r-sf-1; @r-sf-2], [`terra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf) [@r-terra], [`tidyterra`]((https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyterra/tidyterra.pdf)) [@r-tidyterra]

-   **Data Visualization:** [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/ggplot2.pdf) [@r-ggplot2], [`ggpubr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/ggpubr.pdf) [@r-ggpubr]

-   **Data Processing:** [`dplyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/dplyr.pdf) [@r-dplyr]

The following code installs and imports the packages used in this unit:

::: note
Installing and importing new packages may required `R` to restart.
:::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette_packages <- c(
  "dplyr", "ggplot2", "ggpubr", "sf",
  "terra", "tidyterra", "utils"
)

for (v in seq_along(vignette_packages)) {
  if (vignette_packages[v] %in% installed.packages() == FALSE) {
    install.packages(vignette_packages[v])
  }
}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(tidyterra)
library(utils)
```
