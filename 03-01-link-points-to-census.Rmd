# Linkage to Census geographies


## Introduction 

This tutorial provides example code in `R`:

1.  To link geocoded addresses (i.e., geographic coordinates) to the specific US Census geographic units (e.g., tract) in which they are located.

2.  To link data from the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Social Determinants of Health Database](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html) to those geocoded addresses.

### Motivation {-}

Linking geocoded addresses to US Census geographic units is a common step in environmental health data integration workflows. First, using geographic information systems (GIS) software, the geocoded addresses are mapped to the specific Census geographic units (e.g., Census tracts) in which they are located. Second, the Census geographic unit identifying code (or, [geoid](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html)) is matched to each geocoded address. The result is a table of geocoded addresses and their corresponding Census geoids.

The Census geoids can then serve as the basis for linking additional data to each geocoded address. Many types of data with importance for environmental health applications are available by Census geoid. Specifically, the Census collects and provides data by Census geoid for various social determinants of health (SDOH). Such Census SDOH data describe poverty, race/ethnicity, language, housing, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Increasingly, other data providers (e.g., other government agencies, research institutions, community science groups) are making their data available by Census geoid to help facilitate linkages with SDOH data. Such data cover various environment, climate, health, and built environment characteristics.

Example environmental health data sources readily available by Census geoid from US federal agencies include the following:

### Background {-#intro-census-geoids}

The Census defines [geographic boundaries](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2014/07/understanding-geographic-relationships-counties-places-tracts-and-more.html) at various spatial scales. Common examples in environmental health workflows include (from coarsest to finest spatial scale): states, counties, tracts, block groups, and blocks. These boundaries are completely non-overlapping, such that block boundaries are nested within block groups, which are nested within tracts, which are nested within counties, which are nested within states.

The Census defines the boundaries of tracts, block groups, and blocks to scale with local population: that is, in areas with higher population density (e.g., urban cores), these geographic units have finer spatial scale (i.e., smaller land area per unit) and in areas with lower population density (e.g., rural areas), the geographic units have coarser spatial scale (i.e., larger land area per unit). As a result, the spatial scale of geographic units varies substantially across the US. The shape of geographic units also varies substantially: the Census defines these boundaries to follow political boundaries (e.g., state boundaries) as well as physical features (e.g., roads, rivers), which often have irregular shapes.

The variable shape and spatial scale of Census geographic units is in contrast with spatial grids-- in which each geographic unit (i.e., grid cell) has the same shape and spatial resolution. Such spatial grids are common for environment and climate data.

[ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html), which represent the geographic areas used by the US Postal Service for ZIP codes, are another common boundary used in environmental health workflows. ZCTAs have no spatial relationship with block groups, tracts, counties, or states: that is, ZCTAs can cross or overlap those other geographic boundaries. Like other Census geographic boundaries, ZCTAs vary in spatial resolution and shape across the US. The spatial scale of ZCTAs is, on average, finer than counties but coarser than tracts.

The following figure illustrates the variable spatial scale and shape of each type of geographic boundary:
