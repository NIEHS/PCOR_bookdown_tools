## Major Road Proximity {#chapter-geo-exposure-roads}

The following are step-by-step instructions to calculate proximity-based exposure metrics to  major roadways in the United States (US) using US NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) [Global Roads Open Access Data Set (Version 1)](https://doi.org/10.7927/H4VD6WCT). 

### Description

#### NASA SEDAC Roads Data {-} 
The NASA SEDAC global data includes the locations of major roads (i.e., lines indicating roadway center lines) for the US in 2005. Major roads are categorized based on social and economic importance as follows:

| Major road classification   | Description                                              | 
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|  
| Highways                    | Limited access divided highways connecting major cities. |   
| Primary roads               | Other primary major roads between and into major cities as well as primary arterial roads. |   
| Secondary roads             | Other secondary roads between and into cities as well as secondary arterial roads.           |  
  

Other types of roads, such as tertiary roads, local roads, trails, and private roads, are not included.

The following figure illustrates the spatial coverage (all US states and territories) and spatial scale (lines) of the SEDAC roads data:

#### Exposure Metrics {-} 
This tool calculates proximity-based (i.e., distance-based) exposure metrics for a specified list of receptor point locations (e.g., geocoded home addresses) to major roads in year 2005. This tool can be used to calculate the following proximity-based metrics within the US:  

* Distance to nearest major road and classification of nearest major road
* Length of road within a specified buffer distance of receptor

These proximity-based metrics can be calculated for all available major road classifications (i.e., highways, primary roads, and secondary roads) or any subset of them. Output includes information about data missingness (e.g., whether a receptor location is near a US border) as well as an optional log file.

#### Recommended Uses {-}
This tool is recommended for the following uses:  

* Applications for which a proximity-based metric is appropriate. *Note: This tool does __not__ provide other relevant exposure information associated with roads, such as traffic, noise levels, or air pollution levels.*  
* Analyses focused on exposures related specifically to major roads. *Note: This tool does __not__ include data for other road classifications, such as local street networks or trails.*  
* Applications for which most receptor point locations are not located in communities with sections of tunneled or elevated highways. *Note: This tool does __not__ provide information about whether roads are at surface level (e.g., elevated, tunneled, etc.). Exposure implications of roadway proximity may differ depending on whether road is at surface level. Some urban highways have varying tunneled, surface-level, or elevated sections (e.g., tunneled sections of US Interstate 90 in Boston, Massachusetts, and in Seattle, Washington).*  
* Applications for which most receptor point locations are not located near to a US border with Mexico or Canada. *Note: Because this tool does not include roadway data for Mexico or Canada, the tool may __under predict__ proximity to major roads for receptor point locations in the US near a border with Mexico or Canada with nearby major roads across the border. This tool provides optional output information indicating whether a receptor point is located within a specified distance of a border.*  

#### Steps {-}  

1. [Install R and required packages](#step-1-roads)  

2. [Download tool](#step-2-roads)  

3. [Prepare receptor point data](#step-3-roads)  

4. [Run script in R](#step-4-roads)  

5. [Review output](#step-5-roads)  

6. [Cite data and tool](#step-6-roads)

### Install R and required packages {#step-1-roads}

[Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Optionally, [install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Then, install the following R packages: ````logr````, ````tidyverse````, ````sf````.
Follow [R package installation instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-packages), or run the following code in R:
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("logr", "tidyverse", "sf"))
```
    
### Download Tool {#step-2-roads}

Download and save the folder containing input data (````input_source_major_roads.rds```` and ````input_us_borders.rds````) and script (````script_major_road_proximity_for_points.R````). To directly run the example scripts provided with these instructions in [Step 4](#step-4-roads), do not change the file names within the folder.   
  
### Prepare Receptor Point Data {#step-3-roads}

Prepare a comma-separated values (CSV) file that contains a table of the receptor 
point locations (e.g., geocoded addresses, coordinates). Include each receptor as 
a separate row in the table, and include the following **required** columns:  

* ````id````: a unique and anonymous identifying code for each receptor. This can be in character (string) or numeric (double) format  
* ````latitude````: the latitude of the receptor point location in decimal degrees 
format (range: -90 to 90) 
* ````longitude````: the longitude of the receptor point location in decimal 
degrees format (range: -180 to 180)    

The following table provides an example of the receptor point data format:    

|id     |latitude      | longitude      |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
|1011A  |39.00205369   |-77.105578716   |
|1012C  |35.88480215   |-78.877942573   |  
|1013E  |39.43560788   |-77.434847823   |  

To directly run the example scripts provided with these instructions, save the receptor point data as ````input_receptor.csv```` in the folder.  

### Run script in R {#step-4-roads}

Run the script ````script_major_road_proximity_for_points.R```` to load the required functions in R. You can then use the function ````get_major_road_proximity_for_points()```` to calculate proximity-based exposure metrics for each receptor point location. 

#### Description of Function ````get_major_road_proximity_for_points()```` {-}

This function takes the receptor point data above and returns a data frame with the receptor identifying code linked to the selected major road facility proximity metrics for selected raod class(es) as well as information about data missingness. Optionally, the function also writes a log file in the current R working directory. The function has the following arguments:

**Required Arguments**  

* ````receptor_filepath````: specifies the file path to a CSV file containing the receptor point locations (described in [Step 3](#step-3-roads)). *Note: The format for file paths in R can vary by operating system.*  
* ````source_major_roads_filepath````: specifies the file path to a RDS file containing a simple features object with the line locations of NASA SEDAC major roads in the US. This is the file ````input_source_major_roads.rds````.  
* ````us_borders_filepath````: specifies the file path to a RDS file containing a simple features object with the US borders with Mexico and Canada. This is the file ````input_us_borders.rds````. 

**Optional Arguments**  

* ````buffer_distance_km````: a numeric argument that specifies the buffer distance (units: kilometers [km]) to use in calculation of buffer-based proximity metrics. Default is ````1```` km. Must be between 0.001 km and 1000 km. *Note: Larger buffer distance values may result in longer run-times for buffer-based proximity metrics.* 
* ````receptor_crs````: a coordinate reference system object (i.e., [class is ````crs```` object in R](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf)) for the receptor point locations. Default is ````"EPSG:4269"```` (i.e., NAD83).  
* ````projection_crs````: a projected coordinate reference system object (i.e., [class is ````crs```` object in R](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf)) for use in exposure assessment. Default is ````"ESRI:102008"```` (i.e., North America Albers Equal Area Conic projection). 
* ````road_class_selection````: list that specifies the subset of major road types to include in the exposure assessment. Default is all types: ````"highway", "primary road", "secondary road", "unspecified"````.  
* ````proximity_metrics````: list that specifies the subset of proximity-based exposure metrics to calculate. Default is all metrics: ````"distance_to_nearest,  "length_in_buffer"````.  
    + ````"distance_to_nearest"````: returns output with distance to nearest major road (units: km) and classification of nearest major road (e.g., highway) for each receptor   
    + ````"length_in_buffer"````: returns output with the length (units: km) of all major roads of the selected class(es) within the specified buffer distance of receptor  
* ````check_near_us_border````: logical argument that specifies whether the function should identify receptor points that are within the buffer distance (i.e., specified by argument ````buffer_distance_km````) of a US border with Canada or Mexico. ````TRUE```` returns a column with output (````within_border_buffer````) with a binary variable indicating receptor points within the buffer distance of a border. Default is ````TRUE````. *Note: This tool includes only road data for US states and territories. Thus, this tool may under predict proximity to major roads for receptor locations near a US border with Canada or Mexico.*  
* ````add_all_input_to_output````: logical argument that specifies whether the output of the function should include all columns included with the input receptor data frame or not. ````TRUE```` returns all columns (i.e., including latitude and longitude) with output. ````FALSE```` returns only the anonymous receptor identifying code, proximity-based metrics, and data missingness information with output. ````FALSE```` may be useful for meeting data de-identification requirements. Default is ````TRUE````.  
* ````write_log_to_file````: logical argument that specifies whether a log should be written to file. ````TRUE```` will create a log file in the current working directory. Default is ````TRUE````.  
* ````print_log_to_console````: logical argument that specifies whether a log should be printed to the console. ````TRUE```` will print a log to console. Default is ````TRUE````.  

#### Example Use {-}

Below are two example scripts for using the function above to produce a CSV file with the proximity-based exposure estimates for each receptor to highways (using default options for all other optional arguments). The first example uses only R but requires editing the file paths. The second example requires RStudio and the ````here```` package but does not require editing file paths.  

**Example 1: Base R**  

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(logr)
library(sf)

# Load functions
source("/set/file/path/to/script_major_road_proximity_for_points.R")

# Get proximity-based exposures
major_road_proximity_metrics <-
  get_major_road_proximity_for_points(
    receptor_filepath = "/set/file/path/to/input_receptor.csv",
    source_major_roads_filepath =
    "/set/file/path/to/input_source_major_roads.rds",
    us_borders_filepath =
    "/set/file/path/to/input_us_borders.rds",
    road_class_selection = "highway"
  )

# Write exposures to CSV
readr::write_csv(major_road_proximity_metrics,
  file = "/set/file/path/to/output_major_road_proximity_metrics.csv"
)
```

**Example 2: RStudio with ````here```` Package**  

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install here package (if needed)
install.packages("here")

# Load packages
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(logr)
library(sf)

# Set location
here::i_am("script_major_road_proximity_for_points.R")

# Load functions
source(here::here("script_major_road_proximity_for_points.R"))

# Get exposures
major_road_proximity_metrics <-
  get_major_road_proximity_for_points(
    receptor_filepath = here("input_receptor.csv"),
    source_major_roads_filepath = here("input_source_major_roads.rds"),
    us_borders_filepath = here("input_us_borders.rds"),
    road_class_selection = "highway"
  )

# Write exposures to CSV
readr::write_csv(major_road_proximity_metrics,
  file = here("output_major_road_proximity_metrics.csv")
)
```

### Review Output {#step-5-roads}

#### Log File {-}
After running the example script above, with the log file option selected, the log
file will be available in the folder ````log```` in the current R working directory.  

#### Output Data {-}
After running the example script above, calculated proximity-based exposure metrics for receptor locations will be available in the file ````output_major_road_proximity_metrics.csv```` within the folder. This CSV file includes a row for each receptor with the following columns (as applicable):  

**Identifiers**  

* ````id````: the unique and anonymous identifying code for each receptor  

**Calculated Proximity-Based Exposure Metrics**  

**_Nearest Distance Metrics_**

* ````major_road_nearest_distance_km````: distance (units: km) to the nearest major road      
* ````major_road_nearest_road_class````: the classification of the nearest major road segment.   

**_Length in Buffer Metrics_**  

* ````major_road_length_in_buffer_km````: length (units: km) of all major roads of the specified class(es) within the specified buffer distance of receptor. ````0```` indicates that no major roads are within the specified buffer distance of the receptor. 

**Information on Data Missingness**  

* ````within_border_buffer````: binary variable indicating whether receptor point is located within the buffer distance (i.e., specified by argument ````buffer_distance_km````) of a US border with Canada or  Mexico:  
    + ````1```` indicates that receptor point is located within the buffer distance of a US border with Canada or Mexico. This indicates that the proximity-based metrics calculated by this tool may represent under predictions of the true proximity-based metrics (i.e., the nearest major road may be located in Canada or Mexico, outside the coverage of the major road data included in this tool).  
    + ````0```` indicates that receptor point is **not** located within the buffer distance of a US border with Canada or Mexico.
