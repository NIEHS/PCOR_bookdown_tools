# **Introduction** {-}

## About {-}

A collection of my sample r markdown pages. 
Data set is from Synthetic patient and population health data from the state of Massachusetts in FHIR format.
PM 2.5 dataset is from deGAUSS https://degauss.org/
Census data is from deGAUSS and tidycensus

## Usage {-}

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. 


To build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
