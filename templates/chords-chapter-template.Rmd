## Introduction

This is a template [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) file for chapters in the [CHORDS Toolkit](https://niehs.github.io/PCOR_bookdown_tools/). You can directly edit this template to create your chapter. 

Chapters begin with a section titled "Introduction". This can be short.

The following header items appear above the "Introduction" section:

- **Short Title**: This is a short title with less than approximately 45 characters. This is the title that will appear in the book Table of Contents sidebar.

- **User Profile Tags**: This is a selection of suggested relevant user profiles (e.g., students, public health officials, clinical data managers) for the chapter. The CHORDS Toolkit User Profiles Appendix provides detailed descriptions of each user profile. The complete list of user profile tags is included in the header in this file. Please select the most relevant user profile tags to display (and then delete the remaining profile tags from the header above).

- **Long Title**: This is an optional longer title or subtitle with no character length limitation.

- **Date Modified**: This is the date this chapter was last modified.

- **Author(s)**: This is the list of author names with their 16-digit [ORCIDs]((https://orcid.org/)).

- **Key Terms**: This is a list of key terms that are relevant to the chapter. Terms are linked to the definitions in the CHORDS Glossary Appendix or in the NIEHS Climage Change and Human Health Glossary, as illustrated in the examples in the header above. Suggestions for new terms to add to the CHORDS Glossary are welcome.

- **Programming Language(s)**: This is a list of programming languages used in the chapter (if applicable).

## Main Sections

Please use any headings and sub-headings for the main part of the chapter as needed. 

Short headings and first level sub-headings (with less than approximately 45 characters) are preferred for readability in the table of contents sidebar. 

### Code Blocks

Please use the main text to describe important decisions and approaches. Please use comments within the code to explain specific steps as needed. 

Code blocks must have less than 80 characters per line.

### Call-out Boxes

You can use call-out boxes to highlight important notes, tips, and warnings separated from the main text.

::: {.note}
This displays a note with a light blue background and information sign icon.
:::

::: {.warning}
This displays a warning with a light yellow background and caution sign icon.
:::

::: {.important}
This displays an important note with a light red background and siren icon.

### Tables, Figures, and Lists

You can add image files to the "images" folder and then add them to your chapter with a caption like this:

::: {.figure}
  <img src="images/chords-art-logo.png" style="width:100%">
  <figcaption>This is a Caption for the CHORDS Logo</figcaption>
:::

You can add a table with a caption like this:

<figcaption>This is a Caption for an Example Table</figcaption>

|A            |B             |C               |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|  
|1            |Test          |Example         | 
|2            |Test          |Example         |

You can add an itemized list like this:

- Item A
- Item B
- Item C

You can add a numbered list like this:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Citations

Please include citations to datasets, packages, and other resources used in the chapter. To add a citation:

1. Add the BibTex reference information for the resource to the file `book.bib` in the folder `bibliography`. 

2. Cite the resource in the text, using the tag from the first line of the BibTex reference information. For example, this sentence will have an in-line citation at the end to the `R` package `terra` [@r-terra]. 

A reference list will automatically be added to the end of the chapter and the end of the book.

## Concluding Remarks

Chapters can end with a section titled "Concluding Remarks". This can be short.

## Additional Resources

This is an optional section describing additional available resources for further learning related to the chapter topics. This is not meant to replace the reference list (which will be automatically added below).

Thank you for your contribution!
